    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      Software engineering is a field of information technology that specializes
      in the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems.
      Software engineers use scientific principles and methods to create
      software applications and systems that meet the specific needs of users
      and organizations. The software development process often includes many
      stages such as requirements analysis, planning, programming, testing, and
      deployment. Software engineering not only focuses on creating software
      that functions well, but also ensures that that software is secure,
      high-performing, and easy to maintain. This field is growing strongly,
      playing an important role in almost every field from business, education
      to health and entertainment.
